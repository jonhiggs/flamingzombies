[\fI\,FILE\/\fR]...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
daemon is a scheduler to perform monitoring tasks, detect state changes and raise alerts when appropriate.
.Pp
Although some scripts are provided, users are expected to write their own scripts which
.Nm
uses to perform the checks and decide whether a notification is raised. This makes it infinitely flexible, but does require a small amount of programming experience.
