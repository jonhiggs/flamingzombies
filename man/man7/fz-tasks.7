.Sh NAME
.Nm fz-tasks
.Nd A development guide to create your own fz tasks.
.Sh DESCRIPTION
Tasks are typically short scripts that measure whether a system or service is in a known good state.
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
Tasks are executed with metadata inserted into the environment. These values are:
.Bl -tag -width TIMEOUT
.It Cm TIMEOUT
The number of seconds the task may run before
.Xr fz
times out the script. A little grace time is added to the
.Cm TIMEOUT
to prevent scripts from ever being prematurely terminated.
.Sh OUTPUT
Tasks use both stdout and stderr.
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Cm stdout
Everything sent to stdout is made available to the connected notifier(s) in the
.Cm RESULT_OUTPUT
environment variable. One line should be sufficient.
.It Cm stderr
All data is written to the
.Xr fz 1
DEBUG logs.
.El
.Sh EXIT CODES
The following exit codes are supported:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width XXX
.It Cm 0
The task measured ok.
.It Cm 3
A measurement could not be taken. Nothing is recorded and the task will continue executing at the rate of
.Ar frequency
or
.Ar retry_frequency
if the state was previously unknown. Since nothing is recorded, the state cannot change.
.It Cm 124
A measurement could not be taken because of a timeout. This is mostly a convenience that aligns with the default exit code of the
.Xr timeout 1
command. It has the same traits as exit code
.Cm 3.
.El
.Pp
All other exit codes are considered a failure.
.Sh CONSIDERATIONS
When writing tasks, ensure the script exits before the
.Xr fz
timeout. If your script exceeds the configured time out, no status is recorded and the task isn't retried until the
.Ar frequency
elapses again.
.Pp
An error is logged, but this situation can stall the task. It is a serious issue, but can be easily avoided by running your slow-running command with
.Xr timeout 1
\&.
.Pp
You could get meta, and write a task to check that the
.Xr fz
log_file doesn't contain any errors, but that is out of the scope of this document.
.Pp
Each task should check just one thing. When a test cannot be executed, exit with 3 rather than fail the test. This reduces the chance of alert storms when hosts fail or similar issues occur that prevent tasks from executing.
.Pp
By convention, the units second, and kilobyte are favoured. Keeping the units consistent across tasks reduces the overall cognitive overhead, even if those units are less than ideal for the task, at hand.
.Sh EXAMPLES
A very simple task to check the existence of a file:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
#!/bin/sh
[ -f "$1" ]
.Ed
.Pp
This script will exit 0 if the file exists, or 1 if it does not. This is a useful and completely valid task.
.Pp
Next, is a more complicated example that checks that a URL returns a 200 status code.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
#!/bin/sh
if [[ ${TIMEOUT} -lt 1 ]]; then
    echo "Task TIMEOUT is configured too low" >&2
    exit 1
fi

timeout 1 sh -c 'curl -v http://www.google.com 2>&1 >/dev/null | grep -q "HTTP/1.1 200"'
.Ed
.Pp
I'm intentionally avoiding many features of curl to demonstrate how to safely manage more variable runtime conditions while using plain shell scripts.
.Pp
Firstly, I'm checking that the timeout isn't too low. We cannot allow the task to run longer than the specified timeout, otherwise no measurement will be taken. The error is directed to stderr and injected into the
.Xr fz
DEBUG logs. Output on stdout is insignificant and ignored.
.Pp
The
.Xr timeout 1
command ensures that curl cannot execute for longer than a second. If it does, the exit code 3 is return indicating that a measurement could not be taken and that it should enter its retry loop. The timeout configured on the task must be higher than one second
.Pp
We then make an HTTP request to Google, throw away the response body and check that the headers contain "HTTP/1.1 200".
.Pp
If the task times out an exit code of 127 will be returned, otherwise 0 or 1 will be returned according to the result of grep.
.Sh CONTRIBUTING
If you intend to contribute your tasks back to upstream, please ensure they're written in POSIX shell and follow all of the above advise.
