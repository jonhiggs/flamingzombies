# Flaming Zombies Plugins

A directory contains the plugins that extend the Flaming Zombies beyond a simple task scheduler.

The usage documentation for the plugins found here is in the flamingzombies.toml(5) man page.

For details on how to write your own plugins, see the fz-tasks(7), fz-notifiers(7) and fz-gates(7) man pages.
